{`ABOUT_ME.TXT
----------------------------

Name:
Awotimilehin Babatunde

Role:
Software Engineer

Summary:
I build full-stack web and mobile applications and backend systems,
with a growing focus on performance, structure,
and real-world usability.

I enjoy turning ideas into working products,
and I pay close attention to how software feels
from a user’s perspective — not just how it looks.

Stack:
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- React / React Native
- Node.js
- Django / Flask
- PostgreSQL / Prisma
- REST APIs

Experience:
I have built and deployed multiple personal and
prototype projects, including content platforms,
quiz systems, and fintech-style applications,
handling both frontend and backend development.

Philosophy:
Simple solutions scale better.
Good software should feel invisible to the user.

Location:
Nigeria

Status:
Open to collaborations and opportunities.
